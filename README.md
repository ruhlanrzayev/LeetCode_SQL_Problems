## Notes

- All queries target PostgreSQL syntax (LeetCode's PostgreSQL option), not MySQL.
- Solutions prioritize correctness over what happens to pass LeetCode's specific test cases — some accepted submissions on LeetCode use logic that doesn't generalize (e.g., total `COUNT` instead of consecutive-row checks); those are noted where relevant.
